The solution is to avoid using `@apply` within pseudo-selector classes. Instead, directly apply the individual Tailwind CSS utility classes to the element and its pseudo-selectors.  This applies the styles directly and avoids the `@apply` limitation with pseudo-selectors.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  Click Me
</button>
```
This corrected version directly applies the `hover:bg-blue-700` class to the button, resolving the issue.  No longer is `@apply` misused, and the styles will be applied correctly.
