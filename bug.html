This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`.  The `@apply` directive will apply the styles, but they will only apply to the parent element, not to the child elements that the pseudo-selector should target.

For example:
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```
```css
/*This works*/
.btn{
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
.btn:hover{
 @apply bg-blue-700;
}
```

The issue is the `@apply` directive inside the `hover` class doesn't correctly cascade to the button itself, causing the hover effect not to work as expected.  This is because the `@apply` directive doesn't expand pseudo selectors.
